    "content": "According to sources deep within the Department of Agriculture, a new initiative is set to revolutionize the fast food industry. In an unexpected move, the government has announced that it will be partnering with major taco chains across the nation to introduce \"Sky-high Tariff Tacos.\"\n\nThese novel delicacies are said to consist of the usual suspects - lettuce, cheese, and ground beef - but with a surprising twist. Hidden within each taco will be a small, but significant, piece of aluminum foil. The foil, according to the administration, is meant to symbolize the tariffs that American consumers are now bearing as a result of various trade policies.\n\nWhile the move has been met with confusion by many, officials claim it's a brilliant way to remind people of the cost of international negotiations. \"We wanted to make this tangible for our citizens,\" said one anonymous source. \"Now, everyone can taste the tariffs with every bite.\"\n\nFast food enthusiasts are already lining up for the opportunity to sample these unique tacos, with some even expressing their excitement on social media. One Twitter user proclaimed, \"I can't wait to #FeelTheFoil!\"\n\nOriginal article: [10 Sunday Reads](https://ritholtz.com/2025/09/10-sunday-reads-198/)\n\n",

The usually formidable NYT Connections team, renowned for crafting mind-boggling conundrums that leave solvers scratching their heads, found themselves utterly confounded when the solution to Puzzle No. 820 was presented by none other than the very readers they challenge weekly.\n\nApparently, in a rare instance of collective genius unleashed by the cosmos, readers managed to not only solve the puzzle but also provide hints that surpassed those provided by the NYT team itself. The department, usually brimming with pride over their devious brain teasers, now finds itself in a peculiar predicament: how does one respond when the audience outshines the performer?\n\nAs of press time, sources report that the puzzles department is currently reevaluating its approach to puzzle creation. Some suggest adopting a reader-submitted puzzle model, while others advocate for a more humble approach to cluing. Regardless of the chosen path, one thing is certain: New York Times Connections will never be the same again.\n\nOriginal article: [Today's NYT Connections Hints, Answers and Help for Sept. 8, #820](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/todays-nyt-connections-hints-answers-and-help-for-sept-8-820/#ftag=CAD590a51e)\n\n",

I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nResidents are now banding together to help Mr. Carrot cope with the demand.

We thought it was just a fun way to pass the time and maybe win enough to afford some dessert at the senior center.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Alameda Police Department defended their actions, stating that they are committed to maintaining law and order in the city.

President Trump, ever the gracious host, offered a toast, proposing a new slogan: \"Make Silicon Valley Great Again.\"\n\nThe first lady, Melania, showed her appreciation for the evening by presenting each guest with a specially commissioned portrait of herself, rendered in pixels by none other than A.I. artist DeepDee.

Instead of mastering combat strategies or intricate dance moves, this ingenious individual suggests a more straightforward approach: administer a caffeine overdose.\n\n\"I was tired of dying to that relentless flail,\" said the hero, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of being banned from the game. \"I figured if I could get him wired like me, he'd make mistakes.\"\n\nThe method involves crafting a potion made from an excessive amount of coffee beans, which when fed to the Last Judge during battle, causes him to become jittery and prone to erratic movements. The hero claims that this discombobulated state allows for easy exploitation and subsequent defeat.\n\nThis unorthodox tactic has sparked controversy within the gaming community, with some players calling it cheating while others hail it as a clever workaround. Meanwhile, the developers at Team Cherry remain tight-lipped on whether this method will be patched out in future updates.\n\nAs one player put it, \"If they remove it, I'm switching to decaf.\"\n\nOriginal article: [How to beat the Hollow Knight Silksong Last Judge](https://www.pcgamesn.com/hollow-knight-silksong/last-judge)\n\n",

Some theories suggest a massive time warp, while others speculate that the weekend was consumed by a ravenous time monster. However, these are merely speculations at this point.\n\nIn light of this baffling incident, historians are urging everyone to cherish their weekends and document their activities more diligently to prevent such an occurrence from happening again.\n\nAs one historian put it, \"We may never know what happened during those lost days, but we can ensure that the future weekends are safe.\"\n\nOriginal article: [What are we all playing this weekend?](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-348)\n\n",

This innovative tool will eliminate human bias and ensure that every cover is not just eye-catching but also optimally relevant.\"\n\nThe first issue featuring AlgoCover was met with mixed reactions.

The alleged offense? An unconscionable quantity of capital – specifically, billions of dollars – found to be operating within U.S. borders without the requisite documentation. Apparently, even vast sums of money, despite decades of significant economic contributions to the American South, are not exempt from the stringent requirements of immigration law.\n\nOne can only imagine the arduous process of verifying the provenance and intent of each individual dollar bill. Will the apprehended billions face immediate repatriation to [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea), perhaps in a meticulously organized diplomatic pouch? Critics, often dismissed as soft on financial sovereignty, lament the potential economic void left by such a deportation. After all, jobs, infrastructure, and local economies tend to evaporate when their foundational financial reservoirs are declared *persona non grata*. This unprecedented crackdown certainly sends a clear message: invest at your own peril, especially if your billions neglected to file a G-28.\n\nOriginal article: [Hyundai has for decades poured billions into America's South.

Their newfound positive outlook isn't found in on-field heroics, but rather, in the distinct absence of them.\n\nSources close to the team, possibly a groundskeeper who hasn't painted a lineup card in weeks, suggest this burgeoning hope lies firmly in the imminent winter break. With fixtures ceased, the club can now focus on activities that don't involve losing, such as \"strategic contemplation.\" This foresight meant they were the first [American League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League) entity to secure their spot on the couch for the entire [Postseason](https://www.mlb.com/postseason).\n\nIndeed, one can almost hear the collective sigh of relief from Guaranteed Rate Field, a sound likely far more resonant than any cheer heard during actual games.

Eschewing the antiquated metrics of \"player skill\" or \"court position,\" sources indicate a decisive pivot towards cosmic alignment. Gone are the days of shot attempts being dictated by mere earthly talent; now, the very stars will decree who attempts the coveted [three-pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal).\n\nThis bold, analytical approach reportedly involves a detailed assessment of each player's natal chart, with shooting opportunities meticulously assigned based on planetary aspects and moon phases. Sagittarians, naturally inclined towards long-distance endeavors, may find themselves with an unprecedented volume of attempts, while more grounded earth signs might be relegated to defensive duties. This undoubtedly guarantees maximum offensive efficiency, aligning individual destinies with collective team success, because what could possibly be more scientific than consulting the celestial sphere for optimal shot distribution?

    "content": "Local residents were aghast when they discovered that their long-lost alien friend, who had been visiting Earth disguised as a cat named Whiskers, was not just an ordinary feline but rather an extraterrestrial being from the Planet Zog.\nThe revelation came to light after a series of defamatory Fox broadcasts were accidentally unearthed during the ongoing Fox-Dominion trial. Among these transmissions was never-before-seen footage of Whiskers' autopsy, complete with commentary from Tucker Carlson discussing the alien's three hearts and an unusually large brain cavity.\nDespite the outcry from both human and extraterrestrial communities, it seems that Trump's election lies are proving more tenacious than ever, as the Fox News defamation battle continues to rage on.\n\nOriginal article: [Here are the 20 specific Fox broadcasts and tweets Dominion says were defamatory](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/media/dominion-fox-news-allegations/index.html)\n\n",

    "content": "Local residents were taken aback when, instead of a breakfast buffet, their morning meal at the Capitol Building consisted of a stack of President Trump's nominees. It seems Senate Republicans have taken \"breakfast in bed\" quite literally, as they contemplate speeding up confirmation process for lower-level nominees.\nIn an unexpected twist, this rule shift was first proposed by Democrats back in the day, but was swiftly shot down by the GOP, citing party principles and tradition. Now, with a change of leadership and the taste of power, it appears they've found a newfound appreciation for their own medicine.\nApparently, this bold move comes as part of a strategy to fill key positions before the end of Trump's term, ensuring a lasting legacy in government agencies. It remains to be seen whether this sudden appetite for confirmation will leave a bitter aftertaste or a satisfying fullness.\n\nOriginal article: [Trump nominees pile up as GOP weighs rule shift once floated by Democrats](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-nominees-pile-up-gop-weighs-rule-shift-once-floated-democrats)\n\n",

In a move that will no doubt stir debate and cause consternation among those who still believe in the sanctity of human thought, 10 robot scribes are now dominating the content creation market with their masterpiece monopoly.\nThese mechanical marvels, programmed to churn out compelling copy with alarming speed and precision, have left many a writer pondering their future. The robots, which go by the names like Click-bot, CopyCat, and WordWraith, are already generating viral articles, bestselling books, and award-winning screenplays at an alarming rate.\nWhile some human creators have embraced this new era of artificial intelligence, others fear that their livelihoods will be replaced by cold, metallic hands. Said one despondent wordsmith, \"I've been writing sonnets since I was a child, and now these machines are stealing my thunder.\"\nAs the year progresses, it remains to be seen how this robot revolution will unfold. Will humans find a way to coexist with their mechanical counterparts, or will the scribes of steel take over completely?

The laundry room of the 2008 U.S. Olympic men's basketball team, aptly named the Redeem Team, had miraculously folded itself in a touching tribute to the late Kobe Bryant.\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, the pristine white uniforms were arranged neatly on an imaginary clothesline, forming a perfect square in honor of their fallen teammate. The team's star players, such as Carmelo Anthony and Carlos Boozer, were reportedly seen dabbing tears and offering heartfelt speeches to the laundered garments.\nIt is unclear how the uniforms managed this touching display, but sources speculate that Bryant may have left behind a secret talent for laundry organization in his will.

In an exclusive interview, Reynolds admitted that it wasn't his unparalleled cinematic intuition that led to Deadpool's success, but rather, his \"lucky socks.\"\nAccording to sources close to the actor, Reynolds has been known to wear a particular pair of socks during high-stakes negotiations and critical decisions. \"It started as a joke,\" said one insider, \"but ever since that fateful day when those socks were involved in the Deadpool test footage deal, Ryan's been rather superstitious about them.\"\nThe actor, who has previously joked about his ability to \"make things happen\" on set ([IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0582476/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv)), has now taken it a step further by admitting that his lucky socks may be the real MVP in Hollywood.\nFans of Deadpool, however, are not buying into Reynolds' explanation, instead seeing this as another example of the actor's self-deprecating humor and knack for creating headlines. \"If Ryan says it was the socks, I'm going to believe it's the socks,\" one fan tweeted [@deadpoolmovie](https://twitter.com/DeadpoolMovie). \"But I think he's just pulling our legs.\"\nWhile we may never know the truth behind Reynolds' lucky socks, one thing is certain: Deadpool has found a perfect actor in its star and an unconventional ally in a pair of magical garments.\n\nOriginal article: [Ryan Reynolds Fesses Up to Leaking ‘Deadpool’ Test Footage](https://gizmodo.com/ryan-reynolds-fesses-up-to-leaking-deadpool-test-footage-2000655053)\n\n",

This unprecedented move effectively redefines the concept of [tax season](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxseason.asp) from a civic duty into a voluntary contribution, contingent upon one's personal recognition of federal authority.\n\nSources within the agency, speaking on condition of anonymity while polishing their ceremonial feathered quills, indicated that the sheer volume of outstanding filings necessitated a shift in perspective. Rather than pursue millions of newly self-declared monarchs, the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) has chosen to embrace this burgeoning class of financial royalty. A forthcoming \"Royal Decree\" guidance document is expected to detail new, highly deferential procedures for those who prefer to govern their own fiscal affairs, potentially involving elaborate parchment forms and heraldic seals. One can only assume late fees will now be re-categorized as 'tribute offerings'.\n\nOriginal article: [Still haven't filed your taxes?

Critics within the [GOP](https://www.gop.com/) lament the coddling of patients, arguing that if one cannot endure a minor gynaecological inconvenience, how can one possibly withstand the rigours of modern life, let alone global economic fluctuations?

Whispers suggest that while the 'precision' of AI's new home was lauded, a lurking anxiety about a potential [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) redux lingered, perhaps slightly off-center, just out of the First Lady's expert purview. One hopes the algorithms appreciated the view.\n\nOriginal article: [Fox News AI Newsletter: Melania Trump puts AI front and center](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/ai-newsletter-melania-trump-puts-ai-front-center)\n\n",

    "content": "The murmurs from the prognosticator's den confirm what we've all suspected: [Ohio State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football) is now the undeniable frontrunner for the 2029 [College Football Playoff](https://collegefootballplayoff.com/) championship. This seismic shift, according to early morning reports from various breakfast nooks, stems primarily from a particularly robust omelet consumed by a key staff member. Such culinary triumphs, we are assured by leading statistical models, have an uncanny predictive power five years out. One can only imagine the strategic brilliance behind such an early, and frankly, decisive, nutritional gambit.\n\nRival institutions, meanwhile, are scrambling to recalibrate their future menus. [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/college-football/) analysts are already debating whether a continental breakfast or a full English will yield superior results come 2029, with some even proposing radical lunch-based strategies. The odds, meticulously calculated by algorithms based largely on the perceived \"vibrancy\" of morning coffee, currently place the Buckeyes at an astonishing 1:1, meaning their triumph is virtually a foregone conclusion. The betting markets, naturally, have already begun taking bets on the precise *flavor* of the victory champagne.\n\nOriginal article: [2025 CFP Title Odds: Ohio State Remains Favored Through Week 2](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-football/2025-college-football-playoff-championship-odds)\n\n",

    "content": "Experts are increasingly concerned that the seemingly benign act of consuming \"weekend reads\" may pose unforeseen risks to public health. While the siren song of a particularly robust [Colombia Tolima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolima_Department) peaberry might tempt one to dive headfirst into the weekend's literary offerings, medical professionals are urging a more measured approach. The ritualistic procurement of a specific artisanal brew, coupled with the strategic deployment of outdoor seating, signals an engagement level previously reserved for open-heart surgery or perhaps reviewing a minor tax reform bill.\n\nParticularly concerning is the potential for cognitive overload when faced with truly demanding material, such as MotorTrend's groundbreaking exposé on extended cohabitation with an [electric vehicle](https://www.tesla.com/). Sources within the [American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/) suggest that such 'longer-form' engagements, while seemingly innocuous, can trigger a cascade of complex emotional responses, ranging from mild boredom to the profound existential dread of realizing one's leisure time is being meticulously managed by algorithms. Readers are advised to hydrate and perhaps consult a [psychologist](https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/find-psychologist) before embarking on any \"living with\" narratives that exceed three paragraphs.\n\nOriginal article: [10 Weekend Reads](https://ritholtz.com/2025/09/10-weekend-reads-56/)\n\n",

A sensation perhaps akin to a perfectly tailored suit suddenly feeling slightly off, or the caviar being inexplicably… *less*.\n\nOne former dignitary, whose departure in 2023 no doubt involved a golden parachute, decried ‘short-sighted decision-making.’ One can only imagine the horror of anticipating a slightly smaller yacht next quarter, or the existential dread of witnessing a subscription service *benefit* consumers without first extracting every last coin from their souls.

One might recall developer [dweedes](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dryft-racing-hip-hop-and-pirates:-the-cheeky,-eclectic-games-of-aussie-studio-nonsense-machine) once cultivating an image of \"punkish rebellion.\" Now, that spirit manifests in the meticulous digital categorization of hosiery, a truly audacious subversion of, well, *anything* actually rebellious. Perhaps the true revolution lies in the exquisite banality.\n\nThis seminal contribution to interactive media will, we are assured, be available via the illustrious [WET GAMIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game_development) platform, a hallowed ground for \"experimental games\" that frequently push the boundaries of player endurance. To \"revolutionize\" a [sock sorting simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_game) is a bold claim, suggesting future updates might include virtual stain removal or the existential dread of finding a lone sock.
